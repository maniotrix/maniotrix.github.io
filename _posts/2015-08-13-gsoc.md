## [Issue #15 :](https://github.com/P2PSP/p2psp/issues/15) tests for player

Player tested separately with gtk2 and gtk3(GObject Introspection).

#### Results:
* Mouse pointer did not disappear using gtk2.Media was played inside [GtkDrawingArea](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkDrawingArea.html)(Player Surface) using libvlc.
* However with gtk3 , mouse cursor disappears as it moves inside Player Area. But it happens only when some media is being played through libvlc.Otherwise everything is fine.
