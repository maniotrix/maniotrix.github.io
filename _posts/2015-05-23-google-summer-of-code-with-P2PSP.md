27 April 12 AM, I had opened [Google Summer of code 2015 Accepted Projects](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2015) page on my laptop for a few  minutes. I heard my other two friends have been selected.I was  nervous and stuck at "loading" on the webpage. Suddenly one of my friends came and told me that I have been selected.Next I was  screaming  and literally  jumped over him!

My Project [INTEGRATION OF GUI,PLAYER AND PEER FOR THE P2PSP PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/maniotrix/5649050225344512) has been  accepted by  mentoring organisation [P2P2SP.org](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/p2psp).
